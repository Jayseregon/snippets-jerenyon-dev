## Usage

Each snippet is designed to be self-contained and production-ready, taken directly from real-world implementations.

Code formatting and quality are enforced through:
- Pre-commit hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for Python linting
- Project-specific settings in `pyproject.toml` for Python tools
- Prettier configuration for consistent Python and TypeScript formatting

## Dependencies

### Python
Python dependencies are managed through Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript
Node.js dependencies are managed through npm/yarn:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
